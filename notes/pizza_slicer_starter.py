# Pizza Slicer
# Demonstrates string slicing
#  To slice, use the format [ starting index value : ending index value : step]

word = 'pizza'

# Note: A slice will always include the first index value specified and
#       exclude the second index value specified

# slicing shorthand
#   we can omit values in a slice to represent the start and end of a word
