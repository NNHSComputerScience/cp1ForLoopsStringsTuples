# Ch. 4: Notes on Tuples

# TUPLE: a type of sequence, like strings, but can contain ANY type of element. 

# IMMUTABLE: cannot be changed once created

a_string = "howdy"
# this generates an error because a string is immutable
#a_string[0] = "r"
a_string = "rowdy"
print(a_string)
# the value of a varaible is a reference to the string; not the string itself

# Creating a Tuple
a_tuple = ("hello", "hi", "hey")
# tuples, like strings, are immutable
a_tuple[2] = "howdy"


# printing a tuple


# CHALLENGE 1: display elements in each tuple with for loop


# len()


# searching in w/ multiple conditions


# CHALLENGE 2: search tuples to find names that are in both using a for loop

        
# concatenating tuples


# concatenating a single element to a tuple


# CHALLENGE 3: use a while loop to add new names to a tuple (as many as user wants)
