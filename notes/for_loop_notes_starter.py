# Intro to for loops notes
#   counting with the range() function
 
# counting with while loops:
# CHALLENGE: Print 'Hello, world.' 10 times using a while loop

# FOR LOOP - 

# Print "Hello World" 10 times using a for loop
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


# Display numbers 1-10 using a for loop
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


# Use i for your counter variable (convention used by many programmers,
#   originating from mathematics)
#   Display numbers 1-20
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


# Controlling range() in more detail
#   Count 11-20
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


# Controlling loop increment value
#   Count by 2's
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


# Practice Challenges:
#   Increment challenge
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


#   Counting Down Challenge
input("\nPress enter to begin.")


# Application Challenges:

# Bug Collector Program -
#   A bug collector collects bugs every day for 7 days. Write a program that
#   keeps a running total of the number of bugs collected during the 7 days.
#   The loop should ask for the number of bugs collected for each day,
#   and when the loop is finished, the program should display the total
#   number of bugs collected.


# Calories Burned Program-
#   Running on a treadmill you burn 3.9 calories per minute.
#   Write a program that uses a loop to display the number of
#   calories burned after 10, 15, 20, 25, and 30 minutes.


# Advanced Challenge

# Pennies For Pay Program-
#   Write a program that calculates the amount of money a person would
#   earn over a period of time if their salary is one penny the first day,
#   two pennies the second day, and continues to double each day.
#   The program should ask the user for the number of days worked.
#   Display a table showing what the salary was for each day,
#   and then show the total pay at the end of the period.
