# For Loops and Sequences Notes
# for_loops_&_sequences_starter.py

# SEQUENCE = 
#   For example: range(5) is an ordered list of numbers: 0,1,2,3,4

# ELEMENT = 

# So far we have used range() to make sequences.
#   Another type of sequence is a _________,
#   which is a specific order of letters in a sequence.
#       For example: 

# ITEREATE = 

# FOR LOOP = 

# So, we can iterate through a string using a for loop just like a range:


# CHALLENGE #1: Secret Message - Ask the user for a message and then display
#       the message with each letter displayed twice.
#       Ex) message = "great"  output = "ggrreeaatt"


# Quick Question: What would display?


# ANSWER:

# The len() function:
#   Used to count the number of elements in a sequence.


# Practice: Save your first name to the variable 'name', and then display
#   how many letters are in your first name.


# Practice 2: Now do the same thing for your first and last name.
#   Be sure to put your first and last in the SAME string.
#   What did you learn about the len() function?


# ANSWER: 

# CHALLENGE #2: Ask the user for their last name.
#       Tell the user the number of letters in their last name.
#       Then, determine if the user's name includes the letter "A" or not.
#       If they do, display "Awesome, you have an A!"


# CHALLENGE #3: Password
#       Ask the user for a password. It must be at least 6 characters long,
#       and it must contain a '!' or a '$' sign. If they give a valid password
#       display "Valid Password", otherwise display "Invalid Password".


# Adv. CHALLENGE: Can you use a while loop to keep asking for the password
#       until the user enters it in the correct format?
